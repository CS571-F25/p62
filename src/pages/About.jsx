      <h1>About AAIV</h1>
      <p>We are Asian-American InterVarsity, a ministry mainly of and for Asian American students dedicated to Biblically exploring, challenging,
        and celebrating Asian American culture and identity though we welcome people of all backgrounds and ethnicities.
        We are pan-ethnic and seek to witness to Asian Americans and the Asian American community at the UW.
      </p>
      <h2>InterVarsity</h2>
      <p>
        We are affiliated with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, an interdenominational national movement of similar
        student groups and a founding member of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students.  We affirm
        InterVarsity’s vision, purpose, and values alongside InterVarsity chapters at the UW and at over 500 other college
        and university campuses throughout the country.
      </p>
      <h2>Christian Fellowship</h2>
      <p>
        As a community, we hope to grow together in seeking, following, and sharing Jesus Christ as revealed in the Holy Bible
        and expressed in InterVarsity’s doctrinal basis alongside our brothers and sisters in the global body of Christ.
